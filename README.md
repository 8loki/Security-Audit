IT Security Recommendations 

## Recommendations to Enhance IT Security and Data Management:

1. **Implement Least Privilege:** Restrict user access to only the resources and data necessary for their roles. This helps limit potential damage from insider threats or compromised accounts.

2. **Develop Comprehensive Disaster Recovery Plans:** Formulate detailed procedures to recover IT infrastructure and data in case of emergencies or disasters. This includes regular backups, off-site storage, and a tested recovery process.

3. **Enforce Strong Password Policies:** Implement guidelines for creating and managing passwords securely, including complexity requirements, regular changes, and multi-factor authentication where possible.

4. **Establish Separation of Duties:** Define clear roles and responsibilities to prevent any single individual from having complete control over critical systems or processes.

5. **Consider Implementing an Intrusion Detection System (IDS):** IDS helps in identifying and responding to potential security threats in real-time, enabling proactive measures against attacks.

6. **Regular Backups:** Establish a routine backup strategy for essential data and systems to ensure minimal data loss in case of system compromise or failure.

7. **Enable Encryption:** Implement encryption protocols to protect sensitive data both in transit and at rest, enhancing overall data security.

8. **Adopt a Password Management System:** Consider using a password manager to securely store and manage access credentials.

9. **Ensure Compliance with Data Privacy Regulations:** Especially concerning E.U. customer data, make sure to follow GDPR guidelines and protect customer information according to legal requirements.

10. **Establish User Access Policies:** Define and enforce strict access control policies, limiting access to sensitive data to authorized personnel only.

11. **Protect Sensitive Data:** Implement measures to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of personally identifiable information (PII) and sensitive personal information (SPII).

12. **Regularly Validate Data Integrity:** Ensure that data remains accurate, complete, and consistent throughout its lifecycle.
